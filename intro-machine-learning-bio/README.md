# Introduction to Machine Learning Biological Sciences Emphasis

This course is designed to provide thorough overview of the field of machine learning with a heavy emphasis on applied learning through examples from the biological sciences. 

The **goal** is for students to acquire the foundational knowledge of what machine learning is, how it is used in biology and how and when to use the appropriate algorithm/s for a problem.

**Lesson Structure**
Lessons will begin with a high level explanation and theory of the topic and will drill into worked code examples of different algorithms. While programming is not the main emphasis of the course, students will be working with and writing their own code throughout the lessons. However, code will be thoroughly explained throughout the lessons and will be written in either `Python` or `R`.

**Homework**
Homework will emphasize previous lesson concepts and code and will give the students an opportunity to develop their understanding further as well as build their programming experience.

**Projects**
Mid-term and final projects using materials taught throughout the course.
